# Album Downloader

A script that downloads a file with youtube-dl and splits it into individual tracks with ffmpeg.

## Why Not Just Use Youtube-DL?
On occassion, I do download albums or audiobooks with [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) that are under an open license.

I frequently found myself wanting to split the album into individual tracks so I could be a responsible driver and listen to my favorites without having to seek though the large file while behind the wheel!

To circumvent this issue, I would toss the whole album in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and split each track based on labels.  This worked great, but was tedious and time consuming.

A friend of mine mentioned how YouTube videos now have something called "chapters".  Chapters are a way of splitting a video on their website into multiple sections while still maintaining the integrity of the individual video.

These chapters can be used to split the album into tracks automatically!

## Special Thanks
A extra special thank you goes out to Tankooni for the idea, and for helping me save precious, ticking time :)
